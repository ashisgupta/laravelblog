# laravelblog

Setup required
Update composer
Run migration

The table use contain is_permission where 0 represent user, 1 represent admin(Blog writers) and 2 represent superadmin(Admin of wesbites)

Register form will create only Users

I have created a middle ware to check Users loggin in User, admin and superadmin.(is_permission in user table stores user type)

Added php git api using composer
Added github credentials and token
URL : url/github  will give all repository
